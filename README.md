This program checks the spelling of all words in a file.  It will read each word of a file and check whether it is contained in a word list.  This program will print out all words that can’t be found in the word list.

The pseudocode for the program follows:
  1)	Open the dictionary file.
  2)	Define a vector of strings called words.
  3)	For each word in the dictionary file
  4)	Append the word to the words vector.
  5)	Open the file to be checked.
  6)	For each word in that file
  7)	If the word is not contained in the words vector. Print the word.
